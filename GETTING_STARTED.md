## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "No data found"

- Check if downloads worked: `npm run validate`
- Try the demo first: `npm run demo`

### Downloads fail
- Your IP might be blocked by Virginia's server
- Try using a VPN (especially Virginia-based)
- Or manually download files (see README.md)

### Queries return no results
- Check if you're using the right year (data might not be available yet)
- Try broader queries: "spending in Virginia in 2023" instead of very specific ones
- Use the interactive mode to explore what data is available

### Installation issues
- Make sure you have Node.js 16+ installed
- Try deleting `node_modules` and running `npm install` again

Once you have data, try these queries:

```bash
# Find big spenders
npm start "Top 10 highest spending candidates in Virginia in 2024"

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Better Results

1. **Start broad, get specific**: Begin with "spending in Virginia in 2024" then narrow down
2. **Use real names**: The system knows "Glenn Youngkin", "Dominion Energy", etc.  
3. **Include context**: "primary election", "general election", "county board race"
4. **Try variations**: If one query doesn't work, rephrase it
5. **Use the help**: Type `npm start` and choose option 8 for more examples

```bash
npm run full-build  # Download data and build database (first time only)
npm start           # Start querying!
